# Wind-tunnel-
💨 Closed-loop wind tunnel built in 8th grade using a CPU fan and locally available materials. Visualised airflow using smoke from 'dhup' sticks to demonstrate basic aerodynamic principles.

🌀 Closed-Loop Wind Tunnel (Class 8 Science Fair – 2018)

In 8th grade, I designed and built (with the help of my father) a working closed-loop wind tunnel for my school’s science fair to explore the fundamentals of aerodynamics in a hands-on way.
💡 Project Summary

    Constructed the tunnel using locally available materials with a focus on sustainability and cost-efficiency

    Powered the tunnel using a standard CPU fan mounted in the loop

    Used 'dhup' smoke (Indian incense) for airflow visualisation

    Demonstrated airflow around various objects including:

        An airfoil

        Toy cars

        A cube

        A sphere

    Explained the basic concepts of aerodynamic forces, streamlining, and the importance of wind tunnels in aircraft and vehicle design

🛠️ Key Features

    Closed-loop design: Recirculates air for smoother, more controlled flow

    Flow visualisation: Used smoke from 'dhup' sticks to make airflow visible in the test section

    Transparent viewing window: Allowed observers to clearly see airflow around the objects

    Compact and efficient: Achieved meaningful demonstrations using minimal power and budget



📚 What I Learned

    Basics of fluid flow: laminar vs turbulent

    How shape affects drag and flow separation

    Importance of test section design and smooth airflow

    How to explain technical concepts simply to others
